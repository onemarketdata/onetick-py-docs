# How to use onetick.query with onetick.py

`onetick.py` is a wrapper around OneTick’s python interface library `onetick.query`.

But unlike `onetick.query`, `onetick.py` is developed and supported separately,
so it doesn’t cover 100% of functionality of `onetick.query`.

Support for new OneTick functionality is being constantly added in the new releases of `onetick.py`,
but in case of need it is possible to bypass some of the `onetick.py` interfaces
to use `onetick.query` classes and functions directly.

In all examples below this code is used to import `onetick.query` library:

```python
from onetick.py.otq import otq
```

## Implementing EP that is the source of ticks

Some OneTick event processors are the source of ticks and they have a special interface in `onetick.py`:
``onetick.py.Source``.

Let’s use the simplest source of ticks `otq.TickGenerator` as an example.
For already implemented and more powerful version see class ``onetick.py.Tick``.

```
>>> data = otp.Source(otq.TickGenerator(fields='long A = 1'))
>>> data.schema
{}
```

When using `onetick.query` the user is expected to set `the schema` manually.
That will let `onetick.py` internal logic know about the fields added or deleted from the tick schema
by the `onetick.query` classes and functions.

```
>>> node = otq.TickGenerator(fields='long A = 1', bucket_interval=0, bucket_time='BUCKET_START')
>>> data = otp.Source(node, schema={'A': otp.long})
>>> data.schema
{'A': <class 'onetick.py.types.long'>}
>>> data['B'] = data['A'] + 1
>>> otp.run(data, symbols=f'{otp.config.default_db}::')
        Time  A  B
0 2003-12-01  1  2
```

## Implementing EP that can be sinked

If OneTick’s event processor is not a source of ticks then it can be sinked.

We can use method ``onetick.py.Source.sink()`` to do this.
Let’s use event processor `otq.AddField` as an example.
For already implemented and more powerful version see method ``onetick.py.Source.__setitem__()``.

Do not forget to update `the schema` if needed.

```
>>> data = otp.Tick(A=1)
>>> data.sink(otq.AddField('B', '2'))
>>> data.schema['B'] = otp.long
>>> otp.run(data, symbols=f'{otp.config.default_db}::')
        Time  A  B
0 2003-12-01  1  2
```
