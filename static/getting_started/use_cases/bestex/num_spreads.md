# Number spreads

The number spreads is a metric that defines how far an order is executed from the best bid and best ask according to the following formula:

```
Num_Spreads := abs((VWAP - FT) / (FT - NT)), and nan() when (FT - NT) = 0
```

To calculate the Num_Spreads metric for each order, you need to first determine the VWAP, Near Touch (NT), and Far Touch (FT) for each order, and then use these values to compute Num_Spreads according to the provided formula. Here’s how you can do it in `onetick.py`:

```python
import onetick.py as otp

# Define the symbol, orders database, quotes database, and date
symbol = 'TSLA'
orders_db = 'ORDERS_DB'
quotes_db = 'US_COMP_SAMPLE'
date = otp.dt(2024, 2, 1)

# Load orders and quotes data
orders = otp.DataSource(orders_db, tick_type='ORDER', symbol=symbol)
quotes = otp.DataSource(quotes_db, tick_type='QTE', symbol=symbol)

# Filter for new (arrival) orders
arrival_orders, other_orders = orders[(orders['STATE'] == 'N')]

# Join arrival orders with quotes based on timestamp
arrival_orders_with_quotes = otp.join_by_time([arrival_orders, quotes])

# Merge all ticks back to apply aggregation properly
merged_orders = arrival_orders_with_quotes + other_orders
