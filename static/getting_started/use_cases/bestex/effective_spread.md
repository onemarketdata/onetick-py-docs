# Effective spread

To calculate the effective spread of your orders, you’ll need to first calculate the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for each order and determine the prevailing mid-price (average of bid and ask prices) at the time of each order execution. Then, you can use the formula for the effective

```
Effective_Spread := Executed_QTY x (VWAP - Mid_Price) x 2 x Direction
```

Here’s a full code example to calculate the effective spread using `onetick.py`:

```python
import onetick.py as otp

# Define your symbol, orders database, and quotes database
symbol = 'TSLA'
orders_db = 'ORDERS_DB'
quotes_db = 'US_COMP_SAMPLE'
date = otp.dt(2024, 2, 1)

# Load orders and quotes data
orders = otp.DataSource(orders_db, tick_type='ORDER', symbol=symbol)
quotes = otp.DataSource(quotes_db, tick_type='QTE', symbol=symbol)

# Join orders with quotes based on timestamp
joined_data = otp.join_by_time([orders, quotes])

# Calculate the mid-price of prevailing quotes
joined_data['MID_PRICE'] = (joined_data['ASK_PRICE'] + joined_data['BID_PRICE']) / 2

# Calculate VWAP for each order grouped by ID
# Take the first MID_PRICE because effective spread uses the price prevailing at the time the order arrived
# Propagate BUY_FLAG to calculate then DIRECTION
joined_data = joined_data.agg({'VWAP': otp.agg.vwap('PRICE_FILLED', 'QTY_FILLED'),
                               'EXEC_QTY': otp.agg.sum('QTY_FILLED'),
                               'MID_PRICE': otp.agg.first('MID_PRICE'),
                               'BUY_FLAG': otp.agg.first('BUY_FLAG')},
                               group_by='ID')

# Add direction (1 for buy orders and -1 for sell orders)
joined_data['DIRECTION'] = joined_data['BUY_FLAG'] * 2 - 1

# Calculate effective spread
joined_data['EFFECTIVE_SPREAD'] = 2 * joined_data['DIRECTION'] * joined_data['EXEC_QTY'] * (joined_data['VWAP'] - joined_data['MID_PRICE'])

# Run the query for the specified date
df = otp.run(joined_data, date=date)
```
