# Order Book Analytics

`onetick-py` offers functions for analyzing tick-by-tick order book. There are three representations of an order book. We’ll show top 3 levels only for the ease of exposition.

A book can be displayed with a tick per level per side. We refer to a level in the book as a ‘price level’ or ‘prl’.

```python
import onetick.py as otp

s = otp.dt(2024, 2, 1, 10)

prl = otp.ObSnapshot(db='CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL', max_levels=3)
# we can use the same timestamp for the start an the end times when we just need a snapshot
otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s)
```

Alternatively, a book can show a tick per level with both ask and bid price/size info.

```python
prl = otp.ObSnapshotWide(db='CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL', max_levels=3)
otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s)
```

Finally, all levels can be displayed in one tick.

```python
prl = otp.ObSnapshotFlat(db='CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL', max_levels=3)
print(otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s))
```

We can output the book (in any of the three representation) on every change to price/size at any of the levels.

```python
prl = otp.ObSnapshotFlat(db='CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL', max_levels=3, running=True)
prl = prl.drop(r".+TIME\d")
print(otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s + otp.Milli(100)))
```

The ``otp.ObSnapshot`` method doesn’t require specifying `max_levels`. The entire book is returned when the parameter is not specified.

```python
prl = otp.ObSnapshot(db='CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL')
otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s)
```

## Book Imbalance

Let’s find the time weighted book imbalance. The imbalance at a given time is defined as the sum of the bid sizes at the top x levels minus the sum of the ask sizes at the top x levels divided by the sum of these two terms: the values close to 1 mean the book is much heavier on the bid side, close to -1 – on the ask side, equal to zero means the sizes are the same.

We display top 3 levels of the book first on every update at any of these levels. There are three ticks (one per level) to represent the book after each update.

```python
x = 3
prl = otp.ObSnapshotWide(db='CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL', max_levels=x, running=True)
otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s + otp.Milli(100))
```

Let’s compute the total ask and bid volumes and the corresponding imbalance.

```python
prl = otp.ObSnapshotWide(db='CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL', max_levels=x, running=True)
prl = prl.agg({'ask_vol': otp.agg.sum('ASK_SIZE'), 'bid_vol': otp.agg.sum('BID_SIZE')}, bucket_units='ticks', bucket_interval=x)
prl['imb'] = (prl['bid_vol'] - prl['ask_vol']) / (prl['bid_vol'] + prl['ask_vol'])
otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s + otp.Milli(100))
```

We can also compute that stats for the imbalance over time.

```python
imb_stats = prl.agg({
    'tw_imb': otp.agg.tw_average('imb'),
    'mean':   otp.agg.average('imb'),
    'stdev':  otp.agg.stddev('imb'),
})
otp.run(imb_stats, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s + otp.Milli(100))
```

## Book sweep

There are two versions of book sweep: by price and by quantity. Book sweep by price, takes a price as an input and returns the total quantity available at that price or better. Book sweep by quantity, takes a quantity as an input and returns the VWAP if the quantity were executed immediately.

```python
prl = otp.ObSnapshot(db='CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL', max_levels=10)
otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s)
```

```python
def side_to_direction(side):
    return 1 if side == 'ASK' else -1

def sweep_by_price(side, price):
    prl = otp.ObSnapshot(db='CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL', side=side)
    direction = side_to_direction(side)
    prl = prl.where(direction * prl['PRICE'] <= direction * price)
    prl = prl.agg({'total_qty': otp.agg.sum('SIZE')})
    return otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s)

print(sweep_by_price('BID', 11896))
print(sweep_by_price('ASK', 11898))
```

```python
def sweep_by_qty(side, qty):
    prl = otp.ObSnapshot(db='CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL', side=side)
    prl = prl.agg({'total_qty': otp.agg.sum('SIZE')}, running=True, all_fields=True)
    prl = prl.where(prl['total_qty'] - prl['SIZE'] < qty)
    # update the SIZE in the last tick only so that total_qty is exactly qty
    prl['SIZE'] = prl.apply(lambda row: row['SIZE'] - (row['total_qty'] - qty) if row['total_qty'] > qty else row['SIZE'])
    prl = prl.agg({'VWAP': otp.agg.vwap('PRICE', 'SIZE')})
    return otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s)
print(sweep_by_qty('BID', 10))
print(sweep_by_qty('ASK', 10))
```

## Market By Order

Order Book data may be annotated with ‘key’ field that lets us break down the book by each value of the ‘key’ field. For example, a book could by keyed by market participant ID, allowing us to see the book with the orders of a given market participant only. Some exchanges provide ‘market-by-order’ data where the book is keyed by order id. Set `show_full_detail` to `True` to see the book broken down to the most granular level. The example below is a market-by-order book.

```python
prl = otp.ObSnapshot('CME_SAMPLE', tick_type='PRL_FULL', side='BID', show_full_detail=True)
orders = otp.run(prl, symbols=r'NQ\H24', start=s, end=s)
orders = orders[['ORDER_ID', 'PRICE', 'LEVEL', 'TIME_PRIORITY', 'SIZE', 'BUY_SELL_FLAG', 'ORDER_TYPE']]
orders.head()
```

Market-by-order data can be used to analyze/validate the priority mechanism used by the exchange.
