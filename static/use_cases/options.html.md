## Options Greeks

Retrieves end-of-day options data for `AAPL` contracts from the US Options EOD sample.<br />
\\\\
Includes Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega), implied volatility, open interest, volume,
bid/ask close prices, and underlying price for a single trading day.

```
import onetick.py as otp

# Retrieve the end-of-day (DAY) records for all AAPL option contracts.
# Symbols are selected with a pattern against the US_OPTIONS_EOD_SAMPLE database.
options_day = otp.DataSource(db='US_OPTIONS_EOD_SAMPLE', tick_type='DAY')

# Merge every matching AAPL contract into a single stream.
merged = otp.merge(
    [options_day],
    symbols=otp.Symbols('US_OPTIONS_EOD_SAMPLE', pattern='AAPL%')
)

# Return first 1000 rows
merged = merged.limit(1000)
result = otp.run(
    merged,
    start=otp.dt(2025, 1, 3),
    end=otp.dt(2025, 1, 4),
    timezone='America/New_York'
)
result
```

## Options Trades

Retrieves options trade data for a specific `AAPL` contract from the US Options sample feed.<br />
\\\\
The symbol encodes the underlying, expiry, call/put indicator and strike price.

```python
import onetick.py as otp

# Define the trade data source for a single option contract.
data = otp.DataSource(db='US_OPTIONS_SAMPLE', tick_type='TRD')

# Return first 1000 rows
data = data.limit(1000)

result = otp.run(
    data,
    start=otp.dt(2025, 1, 2),
    end=otp.dt(2025, 1, 4, 16),
    timezone='UTC',
    symbols='AAPL  250103C00155000'   # Symbol has Underlying, Expiry, Call/Put and Strike
)
result

## OPRA Call and Put Volume & Open Interest Summary by Strike Price

OPRA Daily data is retrieved from the `US_OPTIONS_EOD` database.<br />

Here the sample database `US_OPTIONS_EOD_SAMPLE` is used.<br />
\\\\
Daily Volume and Open Interest are split by Calls and Puts and grouped by Strike Price for a specified underlying.<br />

A lookback of up to 1 day (86400s) is used on the static data so the
prevailing static record is picked up.<br />

## OPRA Daily Volume, Open Interest and Greeks for Selected Underlying and Expiry returned as a straddle configuration

OPRA Daily Volume, Open Interest and Greeks for Selected Underlying and Expiry returned as a straddle configuration.<br />

OPRA Daily data is retrieved from the `US_OPTIONS_EOD` database.<br />
\\\\
Here the sample database `US_OPTIONS_EOD_SAMPLE` is used.<br />
\\\\
Retrieves end-of-day pricing, Volume, Open Interest and Greeks (Implied Volatility, Delta, Gamma, Theta and Vega),
together with static data including Underlying Symbol, Strike Price, Expiration Date and Call/Put Indicator.<br />
\\\\
Filtered for the `AAPL` underlying and expiration date 20270115.<br />
\\\\
Data is displayed grouped by strike price, with Call and Put metrics associated with each strike.<br />
\\\\
The daily `DAY` records are joined by time to the static `STAT` records with a lookback of up to 1 day (86400s).<br />
\\\\
Call and Put metrics are created by testing `CALL_PUT_IND` (‘P’ for Put, ‘C’ for Call), using NaN for the
other side so that averaging by strike leaves a single row per strike carrying both the Call and Put values.

## OPRA Prevailing Pricing or Snapshot for the Selected Time, Underlying and Expiry

OPRA Trade data is retrieved from the `US_OPTIONS` database (sample database `US_OPTIONS_SAMPLE`), together with
static data including Underlying Symbol, Strike Price, Expiration Date and Call/Put Indicator.<br />
\\\\
Underlying equity pricing is retrieved from the US_COMP database (sample database `US_COMP_SAMPLE`).<br />
\\\\
Data is Filtered for the `AAPL` underlying (options via the `AAPL %` pattern, equity via SYMBOL_NAME `AAPL`)
and for the expiration date 20270115.<br />
\\\\
The option trades are joined by time to the static records and to the prevailing underlying equity trade.<br />
\\\\
Because the data may have been published at different times before the target time, lookbacks are defined so
the prevailing values are returned.<br />
\\\\
`MONEYNESS` is computed as Strike Price minus the underlying price.
