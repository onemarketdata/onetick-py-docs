# Earnings Events Analysis

This section contains 6 examples for Events using the `onetick-py`.<br />
\\\\
Each example is a self-contained script that can be run against the OneTick Cloud sample databases.

Earnings announcements are recorded in the `EVENT` tick type
and can be combined with market data to analyze market reactions and trading patterns around these events.

## Event Data Sources

Earnings announcement events are available in the daily market data databases:

* `US_COMP_DAILY` / `EVENT` - US earnings events

## Event Types

The EVENT tick type records two primary event types, held in the `EVENT_TYPE` field:

* `EARNING_DATE` - Earnings announcement dates
* `COMPANY_CONFERENCE_CALL` - Scheduled conference call dates

These events are useful for analyzing market behavior around significant corporate announcements.

## Earnings Event History for Specified Symbol

Retrieve all earnings events recorded for a specific symbol within a time range.<br />
\\\\
This shows all historical earnings announcements for a company.

```
import onetick.py as otp

data = otp.DataSource(db='US_COMP_DAILY', tick_type='EVENT')

result = otp.run(data,
                 start=otp.dt(2026, 1, 1),
                 end=otp.dt(2026, 6, 12),
                 timezone='America/New_York',
                 symbols='CSCO')
result
```

## Earnings Event History for all US Companies across a time range

Retrieve all earnings events across every symbol in the database within a specified time range,
by merging across ``otp.Symbols``, the equivalent of SQL’s `SYMBOL_NAME LIKE '%'`.<br />
\\\\
This provides a comprehensive view of earnings announcements during a particular period.<br />
\\\\
`identify_input_ts` adds the `SYMBOL_NAME` of each tick to the output.

```
import onetick.py as otp

data = otp.DataSource(db='US_COMP_DAILY', tick_type='EVENT')

# Merge the events for every symbol in the database into a single stream.
# identify_input_ts adds the SYMBOL_NAME of each tick to the output.
data = otp.merge([data],
                 symbols=otp.Symbols(db='US_COMP_DAILY', for_tick_type='EVENT'),
                 identify_input_ts=True)

result = otp.run(data,
                 start=otp.dt(2024, 1, 1),
                 end=otp.dt(2024, 1, 5),
                 timezone='America/New_York')
result
```

## Joining Daily Pricing to US Earning Events

Correlate daily pricing data with earnings events to analyze closing prices and volume
on earnings announcement dates.<br />
\\\\
Earnings events (excluding conference calls) are joined to the daily price/volume record
for the same symbol with ``otp.join``, keyed on the date.<br />
\\\\
As closing prices and events occur at different times of day,
both sides are truncated to the day with the
``.dt.date_trunc``
accessor before joining.<br />
\\\\
A left outer join keeps every daily record, with `EVENT_TYPE` populated only on event days.

```
import onetick.py as otp

# Daily pricing, filtered to the composite (empty EXCHANGE).
day = otp.DataSource(db='US_COMP_DAILY', tick_type='DAY')
day = day.where(day['EXCHANGE'] == '')
day = day[['CLOSE', 'VOLUME']]

# Earnings events only, excluding the conference calls.
event = otp.DataSource(db='US_COMP_DAILY', tick_type='EVENT',
                       schema_policy='manual', schema={'EVENT_TYPE': str})
event = event.where(event['EVENT_TYPE'] == 'EARNING_DATE')
event = event[['EVENT_TYPE']]

# Truncate both sides to the day so the differing intraday times still match.
day['DAY_KEY'] = day['TIMESTAMP'].dt.date_trunc('day')
event['DAY_KEY'] = event['TIMESTAMP'].dt.date_trunc('day')

# Left outer join keeps every daily record, with EVENT_TYPE populated only on event days.
data = otp.join(day, event, on=day['DAY_KEY'] == event['DAY_KEY'], how='left_outer')
data = data[['CLOSE', 'VOLUME', 'EVENT_TYPE']]

result = otp.run(data,
                 start=otp.dt(2024, 1, 1),
                 end=otp.dt(2024, 4, 1),
                 timezone='America/New_York',
                 symbols='CSCO')
result
```

## Combining or Unioning Daily Pricing and US Earnings Events

Union daily price data with earnings events, creating a combined dataset that shows both daily price bars and
discrete event occurrences, using ``otp.merge``.<br />
\\\\
This is useful for time series visualization and analysis spanning both continuous pricing and discrete events.<br />
\\\\
The output schema is standardized across both branches:
setting `CLOSE` as ``otp.nan`` and `VOLUME` as 0 for the event rows,
and `EVENT_TYPE` as an empty [`otp.string[40]`](https://docs.pip.distribution.sol.onetick.com/api/types/string.html.md#onetick.py.string) for the daily pricing rows.

```
import onetick.py as otp

# Daily pricing, filtered to the composite (empty EXCHANGE).
day = otp.DataSource(db='US_COMP_DAILY', tick_type='DAY')
day = day.where(day['EXCHANGE'] == '')
day = day[['CLOSE', 'VOLUME']]
day['EVENT'] = 0
day['EVENT_TYPE'] = otp.string`40`

# Earnings events only, shaped to the same schema as the daily pricing.
event = otp.DataSource(db='US_COMP_DAILY', tick_type='EVENT',
                       schema_policy='manual', schema={'EVENT_TYPE': otp.string[40]})
event = event.where(event['EVENT_TYPE'] == 'EARNING_DATE')
event['CLOSE'] = otp.nan
event['VOLUME'] = 0
event['EVENT'] = 1
event = event[['CLOSE', 'VOLUME', 'EVENT', 'EVENT_TYPE']]

# Union the two streams.
data = otp.merge([day, event])

result = otp.run(data,
                 start=otp.dt(2024, 1, 1),
                 end=otp.dt(2024, 4, 1),
                 timezone='America/New_York',
                 symbols='CSCO')
result
```

## Combining or Unioning 1 Minute Trade Bars and US Earnings Events

Merge pre-calculated 1 minute trade bar data with earnings events on the same day,
allowing analysis of intraday price movement patterns around earnings announcements,
using ``otp.merge``.<br />
\\\\
The output schema is standardized across both branches:
setting `LAST` as ``otp.nan`` and `VOLUME` as 0 for the event rows,
and `EVENT_TYPE` as an empty [`otp.string[40]`](https://docs.pip.distribution.sol.onetick.com/api/types/string.html.md#onetick.py.string) for the bar rows.

```
import onetick.py as otp

# Pre-calculated 1 minute trade bars.
bars = otp.DataSource(db='US_COMP_BARS', tick_type='TRD_1M')
bars = bars[['LAST', 'VOLUME']]
bars['EVENT'] = 0
bars['EVENT_TYPE'] = otp.string`40`

# Earnings events only, shaped to the same schema as the bars.
event = otp.DataSource(db='US_COMP_DAILY', tick_type='EVENT',
                       schema_policy='manual', schema={'EVENT_TYPE': otp.string[40]})
event = event.where(event['EVENT_TYPE'] == 'EARNING_DATE')
event['LAST'] = otp.nan
event['VOLUME'] = 0
event['EVENT'] = 1
event = event[['LAST', 'VOLUME', 'EVENT', 'EVENT_TYPE']]

# Union the two streams.
data = otp.merge([bars, event])

result = otp.run(data,
                 start=otp.dt(2024, 2, 14),
                 end=otp.dt(2024, 2, 15),
                 timezone='America/New_York',
                 symbols='CSCO')
result
```

## Combining or Unioning Trades and US Earnings Events

Combine individual trade data with earnings events into a unified stream, creating a single data source that
captures both transaction-level activity and corporate announcements, using ``otp.merge``.<br />
\\\\
The output schema is standardized across both branches:
setting `PRICE` as ``otp.nan`` and `SIZE` as 0 for the event rows,
and `EVENT_TYPE` as an empty [`otp.string[40]`](https://docs.pip.distribution.sol.onetick.com/api/types/string.html.md#onetick.py.string) for the trade rows.

```
import onetick.py as otp

# Trades from the US Composite.
trd = otp.DataSource(db='US_COMP', tick_type='TRD')
trd = trd[['PRICE', 'SIZE']]
trd['EVENT'] = 0
trd['EVENT_TYPE'] = otp.string`40`

# Earnings events only, shaped to the same schema as the trades.
event = otp.DataSource(db='US_COMP_DAILY', tick_type='EVENT',
                       schema_policy='manual', schema={'EVENT_TYPE': otp.string[40]})
event = event.where(event['EVENT_TYPE'] == 'EARNING_DATE')
event['PRICE'] = otp.nan
event['SIZE'] = 0
event['EVENT'] = 1
event = event[['PRICE', 'SIZE', 'EVENT', 'EVENT_TYPE']]

# Union the two streams.
data = otp.merge([trd, event])

# get only first 1000 rows
data = data.limit(1000)

result = otp.run(data,
                 start=otp.dt(2024, 2, 14),
                 end=otp.dt(2024, 2, 15),
                 timezone='America/New_York',
                 symbols='CSCO')
result
```
