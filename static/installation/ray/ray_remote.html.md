#### ATTENTION
**DEPRECATED** - this section is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
Please, consider using the WebAPI instead, details `here`.

Ray is a distributed execution framework for Python, and you can run `onetick.py` code remotely on your dedicated Ray instance,
without need to installing OneTick binaries locally.

## Remote OTP Concepts

Although, it isn’t possible to use `onetick.py` without OneTick installation and its binaries,
but it is still possible to run `onetick.py` code remotely on Ray instance, while developing locally in your preferable IDE or Jupyter.

Each request to Ray server needs to be done in initialized context:

```
import ray
ray.init()
```

To `onetick-py` code you need to locate it inside some function,
which in turn must be decorated with `@ray.remote(max_retries=1)` decorator to become so called “remote function”.
Argument `max_retries=1` is good to avoid retrying for failing calls of remote function,
which is most probable will be caused by mistakes in your `onetick.py` code.

```
import onetick.py as otp

@ray.remote(max_retries=1)
def example_otp_code():
    # here your OTP code goes
    ...
    return results
```

Following code runs remote function on Ray instance and return the results.

```
result = ray.get(example_otp_code.remote())
```

When you finish, it is **necessary to shutdown your Ray connection** (don’t forget to do it, as it is could lead to memory consumption on Ray server):

```
ray.shutdown()
```
