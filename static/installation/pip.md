# Other installation options

## Prerequisites

- You installed `python 3.10 or newer`.
- You installed `pip`.
- Optional, but it is **highly recommended** to use virtual environment for Python packages.
  > Create and activate it with following commands:
  > - Linux / MacOS: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
  > - Windows (cmd): `python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate`

## Installation from OneTick pip server

All recent `onetick-py` versions are now available on PyPI: `https://pypi.org/project/onetick-py/`.

But in some cases, if you need some older or development versions, they can be installed from OneTick pip server.

Ask your OneMarketData rep for a USERNAME and PASSWORD and run the command below:

```
pip install --index-url https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@pip.distribution.sol.onetick.com/simple/ "onetick-py[webapi]"
```

If you need to use proxy to reach external server, you need to specify it separately
(replace `https://user_name:password@proxyname:port` in the command with your proxy credentials):

```
pip install --index-url https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@pip.distribution.sol.onetick.com/simple/ --proxy https://user_name:password@proxyname:port "onetick-py[webapi]"
```

For MacOS, additionally run: `pip install "pyarrow<16"`

## Installation with strict dependencies

The `onetick.py` depends on pandas, numpy and some other publicly available packages.

Full list of requirements can be displayed like this:

```
pip show onetick-py
```

`onetick-py` doesn’t depend on fixed versions of numpy and pandas, different versions are supported.
But there is a set of versions that are used for testing, which can be installed with `strict` extra:

```
pip install "onetick-py[strict]"
```

## Installation without internet connection

If your machine will not be connected to the internet, you can download the wheel files from pip repository,
and then distribute them to your machines:

```
pip download -d /path/to/wheel/files "onetick-py[webapi]"
```

Then you can install onetick-py with the following command:

```
pip install --no-index --find-links=/path/to/wheel/files "onetick-py[webapi]"
```

## Installation with local pip

1. You should add pip.sol.onetick.com to your pip config file:

- for Linux
  : put into ~/.pip/pip.conf

```
[global]
extra-index-url = https://pip.sol.onetick.com
```

- for Windows
  : create pip.ini file

```
cd %APPDATA%
mkdir pip
type nul > pip\pip.ini # it creates new file
notepad pip\pip.ini
