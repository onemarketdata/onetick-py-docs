# Installation

This section describes how to install the onetick-py package to use remotely with OneTick REST API,
such as used by `OneTick Cloud`.
In this case, the package does not require OneTick binaries to be installed on the client side.

- If you have OneTick binaries installed on your machine and want to use onetick-py locally with them,
  please refer to the `On-Premises Installation` section.
- If you want to configure your on-premise OneTick server with WebAPI support,
  see `WebAPI with on-prem OneTick server`.
- If you need to install onetick-py from OneTick’s pip-servers or install onetick-py without internet connection,
  see `Other installation options`.

## Prerequisites

- You installed `python 3.10 or newer`.
- You installed `pip`.
- Optional, but it is **highly recommended** to use virtual environment for Python packages.
  > Create and activate it with following commands:
  > - Linux / MacOS: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
  > - Windows (cmd): `python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate`

## Installation from PyPI

The latest version of onetick-py is available on PyPI: `https://pypi.org/project/onetick-py/`.

```
pip install onetick-py[webapi]
```

`webapi` extra is needed to install additional dependencies required for REST connectivity to the OneTick server,
over either HTTP or HTTPS using Arrow as a transport format.
