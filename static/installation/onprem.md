# onetick-py with local OneTick binaries

For most customers pursuing tick analytics use cases, we recommend using the default installation method (WebAPI) described `here`.

This installation method is specifically  for customers with an on-prem server installation of OneTick who:

1. Have not yet upgraded to a OneTick version that supports WebAPI, or
2. Rely on data processing pipelines that require running OneTick “locally” without specifying a CONTEXT for the tick server—for example, executing tickdb_query.exe without a CONTEXT.

If your setup matches these conditions, proceed with the instructions below to ensure optimal configuration.

## Prerequisites

- You installed OneTick and have an active license or you are using hosted OneTick.
- You installed `python>=3.10` (with dynamic libraries such as libpython3.10.so.1.0).
- You installed `pip`.

## Installation from PyPI

The latest version of onetick-py is available on PyPI: `https://pypi.org/project/onetick-py/`.

```
pip install onetick-py
```

Other installation options are also available: `Other installation options`.

## Environment variables

In “local installation” mode `onetick-py` depends on the `onetick.query` python package distributed as a part of OneTick build.

The path to this OneTick directory must be set in the environment variable, so `onetick-py` can find it.

These environment variables can be used:

* **MAIN_ONE_TICK_DIR** (recommended)
* *PYTHONPATH* (deprecated)

**MAIN_ONE_TICK_DIR** is available on all recent onetick-py versions (since 1.69.0 version)
and recommended to be used in almost all types of local setups.

#### WARNING
The values below are just an example, you should update them according to your
existing OneTick installation path

**MAIN_ONE_TICK_DIR** variable should be set like this:

- for Linux add the following to your `.bashrc` or other initialization file:

```
export MAIN_ONE_TICK_DIR="/opt/one_market_data/one_tick"
```

- for Windows set your **MAIN_ONE_TICK_DIR** variable to this value:
  > `C:\omd\one_market_data\one_tick`
  > 

Using **PYTHONPATH** is *deprecated* and is not recommended to be used unless you use a very old `onetick-py` version.
If you have used `onetick.query` library separately
then it’s likely you already have **PYTHONPATH** variable updated with paths to OneTick python directories.
In this case `onetick-py` will also work, but it’s recommended to switch to using **MAIN_ONE_TICK_DIR**.

If both **MAIN_ONE_TICK_DIR** and **PYTHONPATH** are set and `onetick-py` is found in both directories,
then `onetick-py` library located in **PYTHONPATH** will be used, due to how python interpreter works.

#### NOTE
In some OneTick builds (from *20230711-0* to *20241018-0*)
`onetick-py` was also distributed as a part of OneTick distribution.

Because of the way **PYTHONPATH** works in python, having two directories of `onetick-py`,
one specified in **PYTHONPATH** and one installed from pip, will result in the OneTick
distributed `onetick-py` overriding the one installed from pip.

So in this case, if you want to use the latest version of `onetick-py` installed from pip,
you will need to remove OneTick directories from **PYTHONPATH** and to create **MAIN_ONE_TICK_DIR** instead.
You will still be able to use `onetick.query` too with this method.

**PYTHONPATH** variable can be set like this:
