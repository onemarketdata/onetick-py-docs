# Overview

`onetick.py` is a versatile and efficient Python library designed for handling tick data with ease.
It harnesses the power of OneTick, the industry-leading tick analytics technology, to process tick
data at unparalleled speeds. This library is tailored both for existing OneTick users,
as a Python interface into OneTick, and for new users who seek an intuitive tool for tick data analysis
that comes with tick data from 200+ exchanges.

The primary strength of `onetick.py` lies in its similarity to the popular Python library, Pandas.
Users familiar with Pandas find `onetick.py` easy to learn. In particular, `onetick.py` users
can think in terms of Python expressions, built-ins, and native math operations on tick fields.

`onetick.py` goes far beyond the functionality that exists in Pandas exposing all of the power of OneTick
(decades of development for the capital markets use cases) in a Pandas-like style. Crucially, the
Pandas-like syntax is translated into the OneTick query language, executing on the high-performance
OneTick tick server engine. In a nutshell, `onetick.py` combines the ease of use of Python
with the performance of  OneTick.

## Installation

The latest version of `onetick-py` is available on PyPI: `https://pypi.org/project/onetick-py/`.

```
pip install onetick-py[webapi]
```

Use `webapi` extra to easily use it with remote OneTick REST Servers, such as `OneTick Cloud`.
