# Prerequisites

We use `pytest` as a testing framework.

If you are not familiar with it you can view a quick example by following the link above.
We chose the `pytest` framework because of:

- ease of reading and writing tests
- auto discovery feature that allows executing all available tests with a single command:
  it finds every test starting with the `test_` prefix in every subfolder.
- many useful plugins for checking memory consumption, time of execution, coverage and mocking.

Another tool that we use for testing is our `onetick-py-test` pytest plugin
that collects helpful things to ease testing and debugging with OneTick.

It’s built on top of the `pytest` and `onetick-py` but needs to be installed separately as a python package.

## Installation

The `onetick-py-test` package currently is only available on the internal OneTick pip-servers.

It can be installed as easily as `onetick-py` by using pip command.

First option (available with OneTick VPN):

```
pip install -U --index-url https://pip.sol.onetick.com onetick-py-test
```

Second option (public server, ask your OneMarketData rep for a USERNAME and PASSWORD):

```
pip install -U --index-url https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@pip.distribution.sol.onetick.com/simple/ onetick-py-test
```

This command automatically installs the `pytest` package and the necessary dependencies.
