# otp.CallbackBase

### *class* CallbackBase

Bases: `CallbackBase`

Base class for user-defined callback classes
for ``onetick.py.run()`` callback mode.

#### NOTE
Callbacks are executed sequentially, so make sure
they don’t take too much time to execute.

##### Examples

```
>>> t = otp.Ticks(A=[1, 2, 3])
>>> class NumTicksCallback(otp.CallbackBase):
...     def __init__(self):
...         self.num_ticks = 0
...     def process_tick(self, tick, time):
...         self.num_ticks += 1
>>> callback = NumTicksCallback()
>>> otp.run(t, callback=callback)
>>> callback.num_ticks
3
```

##### SEE ALSO
``onetick.py.run()``

Method `__init__()` can be used for callback initialization.
Can be used to define some variables for future use
in callback methods.

#### ``replicate()``

Called to replicate the callback object for each output node.
May also be used for internal copying of callback object.

* **Return type:**
  By default reference to this callback object

#### ``process_callback_label(callback_label)``

Called immediately before ``process_symbol_name()``
to supply label assigned to callback.

* **Parameters:**
  **callback_label** (*str*) – label assigned to this callback object

#### ``process_symbol_name(symbol_name)``

Invoked to supply the name of the security that produces
all the ticks that will be delivered to this callback object.
If these ticks are provided by several securities,
the `symbol_name` parameter is set to empty string.

* **Parameters:**
  **symbol_name** (*str*) – name of security

##### Examples

```
>>> t = otp.Tick(A=1)
>>> class SymbolNameCallback(otp.CallbackBase):
...     def process_symbol_name(self, symbol_name):
...         self.symbol_name = symbol_name
>>> callback = SymbolNameCallback()
>>> otp.run(t, callback=callback, symbols='DEMO_L1::X')
>>> callback.symbol_name
'DEMO_L1::X'
```

#### ``process_symbol_group_name(symbol_group_name)``

Called when a named group of securities, i.e. portfolio, is processed.

* **Parameters:**
  **symbol_group_name** (*str*) – The name of security group.

#### ``process_tick_type(tick_type)``

Reports the type of the security ticks which are processed by this callback object.
This method is called before any call to
``process_tick_descriptor()`` or ``process_tick()``.
It is called immediately after ``process_symbol_name()``.

* **Parameters:**
  **tick_type** (*str*) – The name of tick type.

##### Examples

```
>>> t = otp.Tick(A=1, symbol='DEMO_L1', tick_type='TT_TT')
>>> class TickTypeCallback(otp.CallbackBase):
...     def process_tick_type(self, tick_type):
...         self.tick_type = tick_type
>>> callback = TickTypeCallback()
>>> otp.run(t, callback=callback)
>>> callback.tick_type
'DEMO_L1::TT_TT'
```

#### ``process_tick_descriptor(tick_descriptor)``

This method is invoked before the first call to ``process_tick()``
and every time before tick structure changes.

* **Parameters:**
  **tick_descriptor** (*list* *of* *tuple*) – First element of each tuple is field’s name
  and the second one is a dictionary `{'type': string_field_type}`.

##### Examples

```
>>> t = otp.Tick(A=1)
>>> class TickDescriptorCallback(otp.CallbackBase):
...    def process_tick_descriptor(self, tick_descriptor):
...        self.tick_descriptor = tick_descriptor
>>> callback = TickDescriptorCallback()
>>> otp.run(t, callback=callback)
>>> callback.tick_descriptor
[('A', {'type': 'int'})]
```

#### ``process_tick(tick, time)``

Called to deliver each tick.

* **Parameters:**
  * **tick** (*dict*) – mapping of field names to field values
  * **time** (``datetime.datetime``) – timestamp of the tick in GMT timezone.

#### NOTE
If you are making query through WebAPI mode, use `process_ticks` callback method instead.

##### Examples

```
>>> t = otp.Tick(A=1)
>>> class ProcessTickCallback(otp.CallbackBase):
...     def process_tick(self, tick, time):
...         self.result = (tick, time)
>>> callback = ProcessTickCallback()
>>> otp.run(t, callback=callback)
>>> callback.result
({'A': 1}, datetime.datetime(2003, 12, 1, 5, 0))
```

#### ``process_ticks(ticks)``

Called after getting all ticks for WebAPI queries.

Due to limitation of WebAPI mode `process_tick` callback method, which invoked on each tick, isn’t supported.
Instead, WebAPI supports `process_ticks` method which invoked for processing the data
after the query is finished.
All ticks are returned on the `ticks` variable.

* **Parameters:**
  **ticks** (*dict*) – mapping of field names to field values

##### Examples

```
>>> t = otp.Tick(A=1)
>>> class ProcessTicksCallback(otp.CallbackBase):
...     def __init__(self):
...         self.result = {}
...
...     def process_ticks(self, ticks):
...         self.result = ticks
>>> callback = ProcessTicksCallback()
>>> otp.run(t, callback=callback)  
>>> callback.result  
{'Time': array(['2003-12-01T00:00:00.000000000'], dtype='datetime64[ns]'), 'A': array([1])}
```

#### ``process_sorting_order(sorted_by_time_flag)``

Informs whether the ticks that will be submitted to this callback object
will be ordered by time.

* **Parameters:**
  **sorted_by_time_flag** (*bool*) – Indicates whether the incoming ticks will be sorted by time.

#### ``process_data_quality_change(symbol_name, data_quality, time)``

Called to report a data quality change, such as collection outage.

* **Parameters:**
  * **symbol_name** (*str*) – Symbol name for each data quality change is propagated.
  * **data_quality** (*int*) – 

    parameter has following meaning:
    * QUALITY_UNKNOWN = -1,
    * QUALITY_OK,
    * QUALITY_STALE = 1,
    * QUALITY_MISSING = 2,
    * QUALITY_PATCHED = 4,
    * QUALITY_MOUNT_BAD = 9,
    * QUALITY_DISCONNECT = 17,
    * QUALITY_COLLECTOR_FAILURE = 33,
    * QUALITY_DELAY_STITCHING_WITH_RT = 64,
    * QUALITY_OK_STITCHING_WITH_RT = 66
  * **time** (``datetime.datetime``) – Time of the change in GMT timezone.

#### ``process_error(error_code, error_msg)``

Called to report a per-security error or per-security warning.

* **Parameters:**
  * **error_code** (*int*) – Values of error code less than 1000 are warnings.
